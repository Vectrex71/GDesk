## About The Project

GDesk is a lightweight, browser-based desktop interface designed to provide an organized and efficient way to access your favorite Google services. It runs entirely on the client-side, using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With a focus on privacy, GDesk requires no user accounts or logins, and all personal settings are stored locally in your browser.

## Key Features

*   **üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Interface:** A familiar desktop experience with draggable windows for each folder. The interface is clean, responsive, and intuitive.
*   **üìù Sticky Notes:** Create digital sticky notes to jot down quick thoughts. Notes are draggable, and their content and position are automatically saved to your browser's local storage.
